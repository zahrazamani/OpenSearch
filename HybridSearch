Hybrid search is a technique that allows you to combine different types of search capabilities within a single search query. For instance, while lexical search and semantic search have their own strengths, combining the two search types improves the quality of search results.

Step 1: Create a search pipeline using the normalization-processor
The following search pipeline normalize the subqueries scores using min_maxtechnique and after combining the scores using arithmetic_mean, it provides equal weightage to each subquery.
PUT _search/pipeline/hybrid_search_pipeline
{
  "description": "Post processor for hybrid search",
  "phase_results_processors": [
    {
      "normalization-processor": {
        "normalization": {
          "technique": "min_max"
        },
        "combination": {
          "technique": "arithmetic_mean",
          "parameters": {
            "weights": [
              0.5,
              0.5
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Step 2: Create a hybrid query in Dev Tools
Hybrid search combines different search types like lexical search and neural search to improve search relevance. In the query below, you will run a hybrid search using lexical subquery and neural semantic subquery. The search pipeline created in Step 1 will provide more weight to the neural query than the lexical search subquery.

GET demostore-search-index/_search?search_pipeline=hybrid_search_pipeline
{
  "_source": {
    "exclude": [
      "product_description_vector",
      "product_multimodal_vector",
      "product_image"
    ]
  },
  "query": {
    "hybrid": {
      "queries": [
        {
          "match": {
            "description": {
              "query": "silver bracelets for men"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "neural": {
            "product_description_vector": {
              "query_text": "silver bracelets for men",
              "model_id": "<model_id>",
              "k": 5
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "size": 5
}
Step 3: Experiment with hybrid search on the web application
